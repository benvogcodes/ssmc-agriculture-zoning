Zoning regulations for keeping animals, bees, and agriculture for Sustainabile San Mateo County

##Introduction
[Sustainable San Mateo County](http://www.sustainablesanmateo.org/) is working on food systems indicators this year. In order to help residents understand what they can do at their homes and on their land to promote very local food, we'll create an app that tells users if they can keep animals, bees, or convert portions or all of their land to gardens.

##Data
Data is on the [OpenSMC's Google Drive]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/199shxJaRycwVGXGR46jQNyur960dnPf-L7-lIcXyKRg/edit?usp=sharing) and on the [San Mateo County GIS download page](http://isd.smcgov.org/gis-data-download)

##Zoning Boundary Work
Please read [these instructions] (https://github.com/opensmc/ssmc-agriculture-zoning/blob/master/zoning-workflow.md) for using QGIS to select parcels to create zoning area boundaries for each city.

##Zoning Code Work
1. Find the locations of zoning codes for each city in San Mateo County and Unincorporated San Mateo County
2. Review each set of zoning regulations for residential zones in each city and unincorporated County for regulations related to keeping animals (especially chickens), bees, and gardens
3. Record what you find in each city's tab in the spreadsheet
